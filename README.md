# TransparentAI

An example application of how to use OctoML to build an application.

### Getting Started

Install [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) (I (Jared) refuse to use Make).

To get up and running:

```
just docker-build
```

After that you can run:

```
just compose-up
```
to launch the local development flow.

To launch the OctoML model locally:

```
octoml deploy
```
